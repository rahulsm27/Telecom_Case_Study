# Telecom churn prediction project

## Problem Statement:
The primary business goal for telecom companies is to retain high-profitable customers. Churn, or the loss of customers, directly impacts revenue and profitability. Identifying customers who are likely to churn before they actually do provides an opportunity to intervene with targeted retention efforts.

## Solution Overview:
The proposed solution involves utilizing logistic regression, a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. In this case, the outcome variable is churn, and the independent variables include customer demographics, usage patterns, service interactions, and other relevant factors.

Implementation Steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather relevant data on customer demographics, usage patterns, service subscriptions, billing history, and any other pertinent information that may influence churn.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. 

3. Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that have the greatest impact on predicting churn. This step involves conducting exploratory data analysis and statistical tests to assess the significance of different variables.

4. Model Development: Build a logistic regression model using the selected features to predict the probability of churn for each customer. 

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Validate the model using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness and generalizability.

6. Churn Prediction: Apply the trained logistic regression model to predict the churn probability for current customers. Customers with a high probability of churn are identified as at-risk and targeted for retention efforts.

7. Retention Strategies: Design and implement targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, personalized offers, and proactive customer service interventions to retain at-risk customers. By offering incentives and addressing their concerns proactively, the telecom company can mitigate the likelihood of churn.
